## Iniciando projeto

Começamos primeiramente fazendo a pagina de Router e Coordinator.
Em seguida tiramos algum tempo para estudar a API e ver seu funcionamento.
Com isso fizemos 3 páginas a PokeList, a Pokedex e os detalhes do Pokemon.

### Meio do projeto
Após temos estudado a API começamos a fazer as páginas e inicial, fizemos um Header para todas as páginas e nele colocamos algumas funções para ele modificar os botões dependendo dela. 
Também fizemos uma função para cada Tipo de Pokemon, como as cores do Card, fizemos a função de capturar e excluir Pokemon em todas as páginas, sendo que quando se vai de detalhes da Pokelist tem um botão capturar e na Pokedex existe o botão Deletar.


### Finalização do Projeto
Estilizamos então as 3 páginas com base no FIGMA, com isso conseguirmos concluir boa parte do projeto igual aquele que foi colocado lá no figma, fazendo 



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
